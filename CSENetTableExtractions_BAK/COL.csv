COL P CITAX − COLLECTION PROVISION OF INFORMATION – TAX OFFSET
DISBURSED OR NEGATIVE ADJUSTMENT CONFIRMED
Description/Business Usage
Sent by Initiating State:
This transaction is used to electronically notify the responding state that federal or state tax
monies have been received and disbursed. It may also be used to identify when a negative
adjustment (from the original offset) has occurred by entering a negative payment amount
value. This transaction should be sent only after monies have been disbursed or a negative
adjustment confirmed.
Used on:
Established interstate cases
Relevant CFR Requirements:
"The 45CFR 303.72(d)(1) states that the state referring past-due support for offset must, in"
"interstate situations, notify any other state involved in enforcing the support order when it"
receives the offset amount from the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury.
Automated Triggers:
Determine how the CSE system records when tax offset monies are received and disbursed
"on an interstate case. Likewise, determine how the CSE system records a negative"
adjustment and send this transaction with the negative adjustment amount in the Payment-
Amount field.
Action by Receiving State:
"Process according to state policy and federal guidelines. Update case information, such as"
"noting receipt of the transaction, and determine action needed to update payment records."
Recommended Use of Data:
"For IRS collections, use Interstate-Payment-Method = O in the Collection data block, so"
monies will not be forwarded to the other jurisdiction.

Description/Business Usage
Sent by Initiating State:
This transaction is used to electronically notify a responding state that an NCP’s case has
been submitted for federal tax offset. The Collection data block is NOT required for this
transaction.
Relevant CFR requirements:
"45CFR 303.72(d)(1) states that the state referring past-due support for offset must, in"
"interstate situations, notify any other state involved in enforcing the support order when it"
submits an interstate case for offset.
Automated Triggers:
"When your state submits a case for the federal tax offset process, check to see whether you"
"are the initiating state in a two state case. If so, automatically send this transaction to the"
other state.
Action by Receiving State:
"Process according to state policy and federal guidelines. In most cases, the worker will not"
"need to take any action upon receiving this transaction, so determine what action is needed"
before automatically notifying workers that this transaction was received.
