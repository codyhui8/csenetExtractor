"Sent by any State:This transaction is used to electronically request all available information on a IV-D case inanother state based on a proactive match received from the FCR.Automated Triggers:Upon receipt of an FCR proactive match, determine how your CSE system records thisinformation. Determine whether your state has an interstate case with the state where thematch was made and whether the participant or activity is known. If the answer is no, thenconsider automatically generating a CSI request to the state with the FCR proactive match.Action by Receiving State:Automated processes will include a search to determine whether the case ID is in your stateand if so, to extract existing case information and send the CSI P FSINF transaction. If thecase ID is not in your state, send the CSI P FUINF transaction.Recommended Use of Data:Do not send CSI Requests for each match received from the FCR.States should develop criteria for when to generate CSI transactions and should only resenda Request for the same case after 30 days have elapsed.States should respond to a CSI Request within 7 days.",,,
