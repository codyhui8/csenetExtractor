"Sent by Initiating or Responding State:
This transaction is used to provide the other state with arrears and interest owed on overdue
support information on an interstate case. For the MSC P GSTAI transaction the Total-
Arrears-Owed-Amount is an aggregate amount of child support, medical support, any fees,
etc., and interest calculated on overdue support on an initiating state’s order. It is the total
amount a state needs to collect on overdue support. States that do not charge interest may
send arrearage balances to the other jurisdictions.
Used On:
Established cases
Relevant CFR Requirements:
45CFR 303.7(c)(7) requires the initiating agency to: notify the responding agency at least
annually, and upon request in an individual case, of interest charges, if any, owed on
overdue support under an initiating state order being enforced in the responding
jurisdiction.
Automated Triggers:
Identify whether the CSE system records this action is needed.
Action By Receiving State:
Determine the action needed to record receipt of the interest charges and any other actions,
e.g., follow-up enforcement action by the caseworker. Process according to state
procedures.

"Sent by Initiating or Responding State:
This transaction is used to electronically notify another state that an LO1, MSC, ENF, EST,
PAT, or COL transaction was received, but could not be processed because the case ID the
other state sent cannot be located.
Used On:
Established interstate cases, LO1 responses, and limited or administrative service requests.
Automated Triggers:
Determine how the CSE system determines whether the Local-Case-ID (your state’s case
ID) received in a transaction from another state is not valid and no other data elements are
used to match a transaction to a case.
Action by Receiving State:
Research and store the other state’s correct case ID. Resend the rejected transaction with the
correct case ID.
Recommended Use of Data:
The case ID and other case ID must be included, as received in the transaction being
rejected. Do not use this REJCT transaction when the other state failed to provide your case
ID; use it only when the case ID is invalid and the transaction cannot be processed.
In addition, states agreed that if a transaction can be matched and processed through data
other than the case ID, the MSC P GSCAS will be sent with the correct case ID instead of
the REJCT transaction.
The Information-Text-Line 1 field must be filled with data from the rejected transaction in
